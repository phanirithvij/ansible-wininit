## Intro


## Purpose

Bootstrap ansible on windows with vagrant (prefer msys2 or wsl with alpine)

Just in case I start using vagrant heavily.

Also vagrant, msys2, wsl etc don't exist in termux so might need to have a termux branch as well?

## TODO

- [ ] replicate wsl2 alpine box setup
- [ ] airgap and eliminate all dependecies
	- apk
	- pypi
	- vagrant
		- boxes
	- ansible galaxy collections
- [ ] init.ps1
	- [ ] scoop installation
	- [ ] scoop install vagrant
	- [ ] Vagrant alpine box with almost fully overlapped with wsl alpine
- [ ] Setup openssh on windows with this ansible inside the vagrant box and winrm
