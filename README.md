## Intro


## Purpose

- get ansible working on windows with minimal setup

## TODO

- [ ] Get an alpine wsl distro which is available for installation from outside microsoft store
	- As of now using `agowa/WSL-DistroLauncher-Alpine` which can only be installed from microsoft store
	- [ ] See https://wsldl-pg.github.io/docs/Using-wsldl/#distros
		- [ ] https://github.com/yuk7/AlpineWSL
			- Seems kind of abandoned and is still at alpine 3.16

## Notes

- For creating the init/backup/restore scripts I used these resources
	- https://github.com/agowa/WSL-DistroLauncher-Alpine/issues/2
